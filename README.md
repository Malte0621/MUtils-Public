### MUtils

## What is it?
MUtils is a collection of neat utilities for the Roblox Game Client.

## How do I use it?
First off you need to get a "exploit", see the [exploits](#exploits) section.
Then you simply execute this code in the executor:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Malte0621/mutils/master/source'))()
```
## Exploits
Exploits are utilities for the Roblox Game Client that allow users
to execute custom code and run commands on the client.
With the help of this you can execute the code found at [How do I use it](#how-do-i-use-it)
and get MUtils up-and-running on your client!
